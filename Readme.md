###Week 5 Project at Makers Academy


This week we got new bundle of technologies to utilise in our minds in face of Javascript and jQuery.
Project we being working on this time was to implement Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock on client-side using Javascript for hard logic work and jQuery/CSS for cool animations. Jasmine comes in handy for unit testing and to stick ourselves to TDD. By the end we deployed it to [Heroku] (https://dwayne-vs-eddy.herokuapp.com/) so everyone can play!


####Technologies used:

- Javascript
- Ruby
- Jasmine 
- Sinatra 
- CSS/HTML
